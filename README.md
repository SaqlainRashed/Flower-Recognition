# Flower Detection/Recognition Project

This flower detection project is built using Python, Flask, TensorFlow, and NumPy. The model was trained over 3000+ datasets of flower images, and it can now accurately identify 10 different types of flowers. The project is deployed as a web application, where users can upload images of flowers, and the model will predict the type of flower.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework used for training and building the deep learning model.
- NumPy: A powerful library for numerical computing in Python, used for efficient array operations and data manipulation.
- Flask: A micro web framework used for deploying the flower detection model as a web application.
- Python: The primary programming language used for building the model and the web application.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask web application using `python app.py`.
4. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
5. Upload images of flowers to get predictions for the type of flower.

## Dataset

The model was trained using a dataset of 3000+ images of flowers, annotated with different types of flowers. The dataset was used to train the deep learning model to accurately classify and detect different types of flowers.
